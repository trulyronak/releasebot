NAME
       hub-merge - Merge a pull request locally with a message like the GitHub Merge
       Button.

SYNOPSIS
       hub merge PULLREQ-URL

       This creates a local merge commit in the current branch, but does not actually
       change the state of the pull request. However, the pull request will get
       auto-closed and marked as "merged" as soon as the newly created merge commit is
       pushed to the default branch of the remote repository.

EXAMPLES
	   $ hub merge https://github.com/jingweno/gh/pull/73
	   > git fetch origin refs/pull/73/head
	   > git merge FETCH_HEAD --no-ff -m "Merge pull request #73 from jingweno/feature..."
