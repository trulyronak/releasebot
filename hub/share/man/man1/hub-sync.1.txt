NAME
       hub-sync - Fetch git objects from upstream and update local branches.

SYNOPSIS
       hub sync [--color]

       · If the local branch is outdated, fast-forward it;
       · If the local branch contains unpushed work, warn about it;
       · If the branch seems merged and its upstream branch was deleted, delete it.

       If a local branch does not have any upstream configuration, but has a same-named
       branch on the remote, treat that as its upstream branch.

OPTIONS
       --color[=WHEN]
	   Enable colored output even if stdout is not a terminal. WHEN can be one of
	   "always" (default for --color), "never", or "auto" (default).
