OPTIONS
       -a, --assignee ASSIGNEE

       -a, --assign USERS
	   A comma-separated list of GitHub handles to assign to the created issue.

       -f, --format FORMAT
	   Pretty print the contents of the issues using format FORMAT (default:
	   "%sC%>(8)%i%Creset  %t%  l%n"). See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section of
	   git-log(1) for some additional details on how placeholders are used in
	   format. The available placeholders for issues are:

	   %I: issue number

	   %i: issue number prefixed with "#"

	   %U: the URL of this issue

	   %S: state (i.e. "open", "closed")

	   %sC: set color to red or green, depending on issue state.

	   %t: title

	   %l: colored labels

	   %L: raw, comma-separated labels

	   %b: body

	   %au: login name of author

	   %as: comma-separated list of assignees

	   %Mn: milestone number

	   %Mt: milestone title

       --color[=WHEN]
	   Enable colored output even if stdout is not a terminal. WHEN can be one of
	   "always" (default for --color), "never", or "auto" (default).

       -m, --message MESSAGE
	   The text up to the first blank line in MESSAGE is treated as the issue
	   title, and the rest is used as issue description in Markdown format.

	   When multiple --message are passed, their values are concatenated with a
	   blank line in-between.

	   When neither --message nor --file were supplied to issue create, a text
	   editor will open to author the title and description in.

	   Read the issue title and description from FILE. Pass "-" to read from
	   standard input instead. See --message for the formatting rules.

	   This can be used in combination with --message or --file.

	   Put the URL of the new issue to clipboard instead of printing it.
