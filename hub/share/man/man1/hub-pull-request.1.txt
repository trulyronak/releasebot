NAME
       hub-pull-request - Create a GitHub Pull Request.

SYNOPSIS
       hub pull-request [-focpd] [-b BASE] [-h HEAD] [-r REVIEWERS ] [-a ASSIGNEES] [-M
       MILESTONE] [-l LABELS]
       hub pull-request -m MESSAGE [--edit]
       hub pull-request -F FILE [--edit]
       hub pull-request -i ISSUE

OPTIONS
       -f, --force
	   Skip the check for unpushed commits.

       -m, --message MESSAGE
	   The text up to the first blank line in MESSAGE is treated as the pull
	   request title, and the rest is used as pull request description in Markdown
	   format.

	   When multiple --message are passed, their values are concatenated with a
	   blank line in-between.

	   When neither --message nor --file were supplied, a text editor will open to
	   author the title and description in.

       --no-edit
	   Use the message from the first commit on the branch as pull request title
	   and description without opening a text editor.

       -F, --file FILE
	   Read the pull request title and description from FILE. Pass "-" to read from
	   standard input instead. See --message for the formatting rules.

       -e, --edit
	   Open the pull request title and description in a text editor before
	   submitting. This can be used in combination with --message or --file.

       -i, --issue ISSUE
	   Convert ISSUE (referenced by its number) to a pull request.

	   You can only convert issues authored by you or that which you have admin
	   rights over. In most workflows it is not necessary to convert issues to pull
	   requests; you can simply reference the original issue in the body of the new
	   pull request.

       -o, --browse
	   Open the new pull request in a web browser.

       -c, --copy
	   Put the URL of the new pull request to clipboard instead of printing it.

       -p, --push
	   Push the current branch to HEAD before creating the pull request.

       -b, --base BASE
	   The base branch in the "[OWNER:]BRANCH" format. Defaults to the default
	   branch of the upstream repository (usually "master").

	   See the "CONVENTIONS" section of hub(1) for more information on how hub
	   selects the defaults in case of multiple git remotes.

       -h, --head HEAD
	   The head branch in "[OWNER:]BRANCH" format. Defaults to the currently
	   checked out branch.

       -r, --reviewer USERS
	   A comma-separated list (no spaces around the comma) of GitHub handles to
	   request a review from.

       -a, --assign USERS
	   A comma-separated list (no spaces around the comma) of GitHub handles to
	   assign to this pull request.

       -M, --milestone NAME
	   The milestone name to add to this pull request. Passing the milestone number
	   is deprecated.

       -l, --labels LABELS
	   A comma-separated list (no spaces around the comma) of labels to add to this
	   pull request. Labels will be created if they do not already exist.

       -d, --draft
	   Create the pull request as a draft.

       --no-maintainer-edits
	   When creating a pull request from a fork, this disallows projects
	   maintainers from being able to push to the head branch of this fork.
	   Maintainer edits are allowed by default.

EXAMPLES
	   $ hub pull-request
	   [ opens a text editor for writing title and message ]
	   [ creates a pull request for the current branch ]

	   $ hub pull-request --base OWNER:master --head MYUSER:my-branch
	   [ creates a pull request with explicit base and head branches ]

	   $ hub pull-request --browse -m "My title"
	   [ creates a pull request with the given title and opens it in a browser ]

	   $ hub pull-request -F - --edit < path/to/message-template.md
	   [ further edit the title and message received on standard input ]

CONFIGURATION
       HUB_RETRY_TIMEOUT
	   The maximum time to keep retrying after HTTP 422 on --push (default: 9).
